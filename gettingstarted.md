# Getting started
## Scientific Notebook 5.5
1. Say `enable core` and `enable scientific notebook` to activate all of the commands you will need.
2. Open Scientific notebook. Say `new file` to open a blank document.
3. Say `body math` to get into mathematics dictation mode.
4. To enter the quadratic formula, say the following commands:
    * `x-ray equals`
    * `fraction` - starts a fraction
    * `minus bravo`
    * `plus or minus`
    * `square root`
    * `bravo squared`
    * `minus four alpha charlie`
    * `down` - move into the denominator
    * `numb two alpha` - note that the `numb` prefix is used to avoid confusion with the `down two` command.
    * `right shock` - move out of the fraction and begin a new line
5. Try entering all of the commands in one or two breaths.
6. Keep going! See the [Scientific Notebook 5.5 documentation](Scientific_Notebook.pdf) for a full list of the commands which you can use.

## LyX
1. Say `enable core` and `enable LyX` to activate all of the commands you will need.
2. Open LyX. Say `new file` to open a blank document.
3. Say `math mode` to get into mathematics dictation mode.
4. To enter the quadratic formula, say the following commands:
    * `x-ray equals`
    * `fraction` - starts a fraction
    * `minus bravo`
    * `plus or minus`
    * `square root`
    * `bravo squared`
    * `minus four alpha charlie`
    * `down` - move into the denominator
    * `numb two alpha` - note that the `numb` prefix is used to avoid confusion with the `down two` command.
    * `right two shock` - move out of the fraction and the math box and begin a new line
5. Try entering all of the commands in one or two breaths.
6. Keep going! See the [LyX documentation](LyX.pdf) for a full list of the commands which you can use.
