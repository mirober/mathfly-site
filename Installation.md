**Requires [Dragon](https://www.nuance.com/en-gb/dragon/business-solutions/dragon-professional-individual.html), ideally version 12+**

## 1. Python
* Download and install [Python v2.7.X  32-bit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/pythonfornatlink/python2.7.14/python2.7.14.exe/download) or higher but not Python 3

Make sure to select `Add python to path`. This can be done manually by searching for "edit environment variables for your account" and adding your Python27 folder to the list of Path values

## 2. NatLink
* Download and install [Natlink](https://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/natlink/natlinktest4.1/). Use natlink-4.1 victor or newer.

## 3. Mathfly
1. Download Mathfly from [master branch](https://github.com/mrob95/mathfly/archive/master.zip). 
2. Open up the zip file downloaded
3. Open the file `mathfly-master`. Copy and paste its contents into an empty folder, this can be any folder but it is common to use `user\Documents\NatLink`.
4. Check and install Mathfly dependencies by clicking on `Pip Install Dependencies.bat` in `\mathfly\config\bin`
    * This can be done manually by pip installing dragonfly2, toml

## 4. Setup and launch
1. Open the start menu and search for "natlink", click the file called "Configure NatLink via GUI" and run it using python 2.7 (`C:/python27/python.exe`).
2. Ensure that the details of your DNS setup are correct in the "info" tab.
3. In the "configure" tab, under "NatLink" and "UserDirectory" click enable. When you are prompted for a folder, give it the location of the folder containing `_mathfly_main.py` - your mathfly folder from step three (`user\Documents\NatLink\mathfly-master` or`user\Documents\NatLink\mathfly-master\mathfly-master\`).
4. Reboot Dragon. NatLink should load at the same time, with mathfly commands available. To test this:
    * Say "enable core" to enable the core mathfly commands (numbers, phonetic alphabet).
    * Open a fresh notepad window and try a command like "alpha bravo three hundred".
